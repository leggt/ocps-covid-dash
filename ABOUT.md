## Disclaimer
This is an unofficial dashboard containing graphs and data that have been scraped from the [Official OCPS Covid Dashboard](http://bit.ly/COVIDdashboardOCPS). I wanted to explore the data with different graphs and visualizations and the result is this page. The numbers here appear to be accurate but please see the [Official OCPS Covid Dashboard](http://bit.ly/COVIDdashboardOCPS) for verification.

## Development
This is a work in progress. The code is hosted on github under two projects.

- [ocps-covid-csv](https://github.com/leggt/ocps-covid-csv) Scrapes the data from the official dashboard
- [ocps-covid-dash](https://github.com/leggt/ocps-covid-dash) This page
